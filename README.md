# Description
`As an example of your coding approach, I'd like you to write me a function that parses the Preamble to the US Constitution (you can hard-code it as a string) and returns a count of how many words begin with 't', how many end with 'e', and how many begin with 't' and end with 'e'. JavaScript, C#, or Dart would be the preferred languages to accomplish this. I'll leave it to you to determine the best way to submit your work (on a webpage, as an executable, etc). I need to be able to execute what you send me, and see your code generate its answer(s).  And what would be extremely helpful is if you document the problems you ran into along the way and describe how you solved them.`
